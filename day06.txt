api should return with uniform response ?

=> the data representation --> must be consistant /// contain all the information needed ??

==> using resource in api responses --> return with uniform archit.

{

    data: // contain response --> array, object
}
=========================
to authenticate apis --> use package sanctum, passport

composer show --> list installed packages


when you use it ==> access the auth middleware ?

=========
why we need to add login with github to ower project
--> more easier for the users to use ?
--> no needed to ask the user to fill registeration form ??
---> ask github to give info about this user

==== use oauth to allow login with github

1- user click login with github?
    --> redirect to github  -provider page -
2- user enter their username and password --> (github)

3- github authorize the application

4- generate code --> token , return with userdata and the token to the  client (laravel)

5- client --> use token to access public info of the user -- from github
