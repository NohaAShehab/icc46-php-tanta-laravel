api should return with uniform response ?

=> the data representation --> must be consistant /// contain all the information needed ??

==> using resource in api responses --> return with uniform archit.

{

    data: // contain response --> array, object
}
=========================
to authenticate apis --> use package sanctum, passport

composer show --> list installed packages


when you use it ==> access the auth middleware ?
