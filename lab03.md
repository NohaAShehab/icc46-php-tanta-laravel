# Lab 03 - Categories CRUD with Resource Controllers & Relationships

## üéØ **Objective**
Implement a complete Categories management system using Laravel resource controllers, resource routes, and establish proper relationships between Products and Categories.

---


## üóÑÔ∏è **Part 1: Database Setup**

### **1.1 Categories Migration**
Create a `categories` table with:
- `id` (primary key)
- `name` (string, required, unique)
- `description` (text, nullable)
- `image` (string, nullable)
- `is_active` (boolean, default true)
- `timestamps` (created_at, updated_at)

### **1.2 Update Products Table**
Add foreign key to existing products table:
- Add `category_id` foreign key
- Set as nullable with foreign key constraint
- On delete set to null

---

## üéõÔ∏è **Part 2: Models & Relationships**

### **2.1 Category Model**
- Fillable fields: name, description, image, is_active
- Relationship: hasMany(Product::class)

### **2.2 Product Model Update**
- Add category_id to fillable fields
- Relationship: belongsTo(Category::class)

### **2.3 Relationship Implementation**
- **One-to-Many**: Category has many Products
- **Belongs-to**: Product belongs to one Category
- Implement relationship methods in both models

---

## üõ£Ô∏è **Part 3: Resource Controller & Routes**

### **3.1 CategoryController Implementation**
Create controller with all CRUD methods:

- `create()` - Show create form
- `store()` - Save new category
- `show()` - Show category with products
- `edit()` - Show edit form
- `update()` - Update category
- `destroy()` - Delete category

### **3.2 Resource Routes**
- Set up RESTful resource routes for categories
- Use CategoryController for all CRUD operations
- Implement route model binding
---

## üìÅ **Part 4: File Storage Implementation**

### **4.1 File Upload Features**
- Handle category image uploads
- Validate image files (type, size)
- Store images in `storage/app/public/categories/`
- Delete old images when updating/deleting

### **4.2 File Management**
- Image upload functionality
- File validation (image types and sizes)
- Storage organization
- File cleanup on update/delete
- Fallback images for missing category images

## üé® **Part 5: Views Implementation**

### **5.1 Category Index View**
- Display all categories in a grid layout
- Show category name, description, and image
- Include product count for each category
- Add search functionality
- Links to view, edit, and delete categories

### **5.2 Category Show View**

- `commentable_type` (morphs column)
- `timestamps` (created_at, updated_at)

#### **B.2 Comment Model**
- Fillable fields: content, author_name, author_email, commentable_id, commentable_type
- Relationship: morphTo() for polymorphic relationship

#### **B.3 Update Product Model**
